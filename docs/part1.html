<p>Your Mac actually comes with Python built-in, but don’t use it! This is referred to as the system Python and you probably don’t want to mess with it as it may be used internally by the operating system. I like to use the <code>miniconda</code> Python distribution: <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html">https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html</a></p>
<p>Or if you have the newer M1 Macbook (pro/air), I recommend using the <code>miniforge</code> distribution:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge">https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge</a></p>
<p>Go to the link above and follow the installation instructions.</p>
<p>On a Mac, your Python will typically be installed under<br>
<code>/Users/&lt;your_user_name&gt;/miniconda3</code> if you’re using miniconda, or<br>
<code>/Users/&lt;your_user_name&gt;/miniforge3</code> if you’re using miniforge.</p>
<p>What is nice about having the new Python install is that it’s completely isolated from your system, if you want to start all over again, just simply delete the folder above and re-install a fresh Python.</p>
<p>At the moment (August 12th, 2022), I recommend working with at least Python versoin 3.8. There are newer Python versions out there, but for the most part, version 3.8 is chosen because many of the libraries we’ll be using will depend on the this older stable version.</p>
<p>For reference, once you’ve installed conda, you can refer to their documentation to learn how to use it (<a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html">https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html</a>). In this document, I go over some commands briefly to get quickly get started. But it’s essential that you know how to do some basic things with <code>conda</code></p>
<h2 id="terminal-crash-course">Terminal crash course</h2>
<p>It’s essential that you know your way around the “command line” or Terminal in Mac/Linux. These functions are routinely used:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ls</code> list the contents of current folder</li>
<li><code>pwd</code> prints out the current directory that you are in now</li>
<li><code>cd</code> change directory
<ul>
<li><code>cd ../</code> go up a ditectory</li>
<li><code>cd my_folder</code> go into a directory named <code>my_folder</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>mv</code> move <em>or</em> rename a file. <code>mv &lt;source&gt; &lt;target&gt;</code>. Example:
<ul>
<li><code>mv img_01_ch02.tif img_z1_GFPchannel.tif</code> renames <code>img_01_ch02.tif</code> to <code>img_z1_GFPchannel.tif</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>cp</code> copy a file. <code>cp &lt;source&gt; &lt;target&gt;</code>. Example:
<ul>
<li><code>cp file1.dat ../file1_copy.dat</code> copy <code>file1.dat</code> in the current folder as another file called <code>file1_copy.dat</code> into one level of directory up from the current one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="python-environments">Python Environments</h1>
<p>Before you do install any packages in your new Python installation, it’s always good to create a new ‘environment’ to work in. Environments are a way to create a sandbox for a specific Python projects. So if different projects will require different sets of packages that depend on different versions of Python or its required packages, you won’t have to worry about running into <em>package incompatibilities</em>! The Python package ecosystem is huge!! and sooner or later you’ll run into this problem as you install more and more packages. Once you install Python as outlined above (e.g. using (mini)conda or miniforge), you’ll automatically have an environment called <strong>base</strong>. I recommend NOT installing packages into your <strong>base</strong> environment. Instead, create a new one by running the command:</p>
<p><code>conda create -n my_new_project python=3.8</code></p>
<p>This will create a new environment called <code>my_new_project</code>, you should choose whatever name is appropriate or to your liking. (e.g. <code>image_analysis</code>). After creating this environment, you can now activate it to go into your Python ‘sandbox’ by running:</p>
<p><code>conda activate my_new_project</code></p>
<p>Now that you’re in the environment, you can begin installing useful Python packages that are commonly used for a nice and friendly Python experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>jupyter</code>, for interactive Python ‘notebooks’</li>
<li><code>matplotlib</code>, for plotting data and making figures</li>
<li><code>numpy</code>, for doing any numerical computation</li>
</ul>
<p>To <strong>exit</strong> the current environment, you can run the command:<br>
<code>conda deactivate</code></p>
<p>Or simply run <code>conda activate another_environment</code> to deactivate the current one and activate another_environment.</p>
<p>To see all of the environments that you currently have you can run:<br>
<code>conda env list</code></p>
<h3 id="installing-packages">Installing packages</h3>
<p>To install a new Python package, you can either use <code>conda</code> or <code>pip</code>. But keep in mind that they’re not necessarily compatible with each other! So keeping that in mind, you should try to stick with just one way to install packages (e.g. try using <code>conda</code> or <code>pip</code> for <strong>ALL</strong> installs). There are cases where you can (or need to use <em>both</em> because not all packages are available in <code>conda</code> or <code>pip</code> alone).</p>
<p>Conda packages are kept in an online repository, the default one is <code>conda-forge</code><br>
To install using <code>conda</code>:<br>
<code>conda install jupyter</code></p>
<p>To install using conda with a specific “channel”. A comprehensive and popular one is “conda-forge” (<a href="https://conda-forge.org">https://conda-forge.org</a>). To specify that you want a package from a specific channel, you pass the extra <code>-c &lt;channel_name&gt;</code> argument to the <code>conda</code> command:<br>
<code>conda install jupyter -c conda-forge</code></p>
